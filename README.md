Tech Sector Employment Analysis
The tech sector employment data in Australia shows that below 50000 people were employed in tech roles and today this figure is over 800000 people working in the tech industry. Major growth was observed during 2000 and 2009 for males employed in tech but a much flatter growth for women employed in tech roles, nevertheless a growing trend over a period of time. 
Ever since economies around the world were struck by COVID, dependency on tech increased tremendously paving the way for more job opportunities in the ICT sector. Today the 1 million tech sector job target seems a lot more achievable but at the same time trying to draw people into the field is necessary too. This can be achieved through a curriculum in school, introducing students to opportunities at an early age and subsidised courses to train those who seek to learn and adapt to transition into a tech role.
With the tech sector being one of the major contributors to the Australian GDP, recovery after COVID with push in employment in this sector will be beneficial.
