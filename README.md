Tech Sector Employment Analysis
Data taken from ABS: 6291.0.55.001 - EQ08 - Employed persons by Occupation unit group of main job (ANZSCO), Sex, State and Territory, August 1986 onwards 
Using the data a national level employment in the tech sector split into males and females employed is displayed to show the growth rate over time.

The tech sector employment data in Australia shows that below 50000 people were employed in tech roles and today this figure is over 800000 people working in the tech industry. 
Ever since economies around the world were struck by COVID, dependency on tech increased tremendously paving the way for more job opportunities in the ICT sector. Today the 1 million tech sector job target seems a lot more achievable but at the same time trying to draw people into the field is necessary too. This can be achieved through a curriculum in school, introducing students to opportunities at an early age and subsidised courses to train those who seek to learn and adapt to transition into a tech role.
With the tech sector being one of the major contributors to the Australian GDP, recovery after COVID with push in employment in this sector will be beneficial.
